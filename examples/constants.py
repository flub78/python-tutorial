""" Experimentation on constants 

    By default, there are no constants in Python.
    
    Computer languages should not only be evaluated by their features and what they allow you to do but also by the 
    mistakes that they help you to prevent.
    In this context immutability looks an interesting feature even at the variable level (it is easy to get it at the object level).

# by convention
# using an all upper case  identifier. The convention should be obvious enough
# to most developers so they restrain themselves to change it.
#
# It can likely scale reasonably well, taking into account that it is the philosophy of Python. 
# To let people know that they should not do something, but not preventing them to do it if they really want.
